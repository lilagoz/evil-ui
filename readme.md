# Run

## working on angular

### /packages/angular-workspace

`npm run watch component-library`

another terminal:

`ng serve` or `npm start`

### ./packages/stencil-library

Everytime you modified the stencil components you need rebuild

in a third terminal:

`npm run build`



## If you heavily develop the stencils component,

you have to run the stencil only

### ./packages/stencil-library

`npm start`
